# Fractal-Tree

#### This is a simple app that generates fractal trees based on few arguments: has leaves or not, is random or not, random chance, leaf length, root length, branch length diminuation, branch angle.

#### After you draw the tree, you can save it with a background color or a transparent layer.

##### The drawing time is determined by the CPU speed.
